#N studentes takes K apples and distribute among each other evenly. The remaining (the invisible) part remains in the basket. How many apples will remain in the basket? The program reads the number N and K. It should print the two answers for the questions
N = int(input("enter the number of students"))
K = int(input("enter the numbers of apples"))
a= int( K/N)
b = K-(a*N)
print(f"each student get {a} number of apples")
print(f"{b} apples are remaining in the basket")
